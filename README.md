# Perfecting-my-skills
This one of many landing pages i built while taking lessons from w3schools.com
its not the exact landing page that i was replicating but most of it it is 
i was not able to add some parts as they require javascript which im not that familiar with for now
and its not mobile responsive either .

i built a replica of a nike landing page view it here: https://abongile184.github.io/Perfecting-my-skills/
